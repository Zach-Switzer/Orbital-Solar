# Orbital-Solar

Orbital and solar calculations for a 3U cubesat in space based on "An Evaluation of CubeSat Orbital Decay" by D. Oltrogge, K. Leveque. The main file Orbital_Solar.m makes use of earth_sphere.m by Will Campbell, and "How To Do a 3D Circle in MATLAB" by Kye Taylor. 

When using make sure to place Orbital_Solar.m and earth_sphere.m in the same folder. Orbital_Solar.m will output the average exposed solar surface area, average power and energy generated per orbit, the average energy gained per day for different orbital altitudes, and an animation of the orbits around the earth.
